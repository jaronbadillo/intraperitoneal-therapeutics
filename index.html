        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            IntraPeritoneal Therapeutics was born out of a shared vision by four passionate biomedical engineers who met during their final year at university. Each of us had a personal connection to the challenges faced by patients requiring intraperitoneal therapy—whether through family members battling cancer, loved ones undergoing dialysis, or volunteering in healthcare settings where we saw the gaps in existing medical devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            During a late-night brainstorming session, we decided to take our senior capstone project beyond the classroom and into the real world. Our mission was simple yet profound: to create medical devices that prioritize both effectiveness and patient comfort. This vision drove us to design the first prototype of our flagship product—a catheter system that reduced infection risks while being easier to insert and manage.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, we remain committed to our founding principles of innovation, precision, and empathy. Our team has grown, but our purpose has stayed the same: to improve the quality of life for patients undergoing intraperitoneal treatments, one device at a time. At IntraPeritoneal Therapeutics, we’re not just engineers; we’re problem solvers, patient advocates, and believers in a healthier future.
